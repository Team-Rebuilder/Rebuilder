      <h2>About Rebuilder</h2>
      <p>
        In the LEGO community, models built only from the parts of an existing LEGO set are referred to as “alternate builds.”
        Alternate builds are often much more economical to obtain than typical custom models, as builders are able to obtain all
        the parts they need from commonly available retail sets. Furthermore, alternate builds increase the value of their
        source sets by offering builders an alternative build experience in addition to that of the official model—which is
        especially useful for “army builders” who buy multiple copies of a set just for the minifigures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rebuilder is an online platform for sharing alternate build instructions. Rebuilder draws inspiration
        from an existing LEGO instruction platform, Rebrickable, Rebrickable is currently one of the largest platforms in the
        LEGO community for sharing alternate build instructions, but contains a host of other features such as forums, set
        catalogs, and support for custom non-alternate builds.
